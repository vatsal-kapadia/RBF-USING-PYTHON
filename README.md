# RBF-USING-PYTHON
Radial basis function (RBF) networks typically have three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with a non-linear RBF activation function and a linear output layer. The input can be modeled as a vector of real numbers. The output of the network is then a scalar function of the input vector
Functions that depend only on the distance from a center vector are radially symmetric about that vector, hence the name radial basis function. In the basic form all inputs are connected to each hidden neuron. The norm is typically taken to be the Euclidean distance
THIS IS THE EXPECTED OUTPUT BASED ON CHANGES IN VALUE OF SIGMA
[1, 0, 0, 0]
I have selected the value of sigma as 4
